Requirements
------------

For the Mortgage website required the use of both server side and client side script, such as  JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySql. Most of the server side script will be used to create the login and mortgage application form for the staff to login and record the mortgage details of a client. Client side script will mainly be used for enhance form validation, cookies for form reviewing, and image and animation effects for advertising on the website. 

In the staff member's side of the website we are creating a mortgage application for this we will be needing to use JavaScript and jQuery for form validation, cookies to create an application review page, and Ajax and PHP to put form data into the database. 

In the mortgage client's side of the website we are creating a mortgage calculator. The mortgage calculator will calculate a rough estimates of the costs of a mortgage depending on the amount putted by the client. This requires only client side script to calculate the prices as this is only an estimate for the clients to look at. 

The rest of the website is advertising and design, some jQuery will be use here depending on the design of the site such as time animations events.
